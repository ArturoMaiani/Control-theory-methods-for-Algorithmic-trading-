##Summary

Automatic control is a broad field of highly mathematical methods applied for controlling robots/ cyber-physical systems. In this case such methods have been applied to formalize an algorithmic trading strategy called "Simultaneous Long Short" 
(SLS) which consists of a model free proportional feedback controller.

The paper called "On a New Paradigm for Stock Trading Via a
Model-Free Feedback Controller" authored by
B. Ross Barmishand James A. Primbs first proposed the technique called SLS.
Multiple research direction have been followed from such work, for instance by the paper "Stock trading via feedback control: an extremum seeking approach" which aims at using adaptive control strategies for optimal tuning of the proportional constant in the feedback controller.
